# Newcomer's Challenge
You are a disgruntled employee working as an engineering Intern of Drones R Us. Despite your warnings, their security practices are out of date and you are deadset on showing them just how dangerous that can be. You intend to first mess with your other employees by impersonating them on the company chat. Then, you plan to fix the system and present your findings to the head of security codename: aa-tan.

## Task 1 - XSSGame:
### Scenario
In order to hone your XSS skills for the eventual attack on the company chatroom, you decide to practice with a neat little site you found.

### Instructions
Complete the [XSS Game](https://xss-game.appspot.com/).

Document your process in a PDF.

## Task 2 - GDB
### Scenario
All this XSS work is starting to get boring. To change things up, you decide to check out this tutorial on GDB.
### Instructions

[Complete this tutorial](https://atan.moe/learning-to-use-gdb/).

Submit proof in the form of a text file containing the password.

## Task 3 - Practical test
#### Scenario
In order to prove your understanding of XSS before tackling the real deal, you decide to do a mock test and fix a vulnerable JS function.
#### Instructions
Access Task 3 and alter the code to fix the exploit.

## Task 4 - Weakchat:

#### Scenario
This is it. The culmination of all your work. Let's do it.

#### Instructions
Access [weakchat](http://hack.keio.ninja) chatroom.

Use your knowledge of cookies and XSS to exploit the system and impersonate another user. (You may act as both users)

Alter the code to fix the XSS exploit.

**Hint:** *Much of the source code is executed in JavaScript in the browser.*
**Hint 2:** Weakchat contains several vulnerabilities which enable different attack scenarios.  You don't need to find them all, but you should try to find as many as possible.

Document your process of stealing the cookie and fixing the system using screenshots and explanations. Compile that into a PDF.

Commit your changes and push to the branch. (Include the PDF that contains your explanations)

## Submitting
