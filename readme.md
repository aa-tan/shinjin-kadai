# Newcomer's Challenge
You are a disgruntled employee working as an engineering Intern of Drones R Us. Despite your warnings, their security practices are out of date and you are deadset on showing them just how dangerous that can be. You intend to first mess with your other employees by impersonating them on the company chat. Then, you plan to fix the system and present your findings to the head of security codename: aa-tan.

## Task 1 - XSSGame:
### Scenario
In order to hone your XSS skills for the eventual attack on the company chatroom, you decide to practice with a neat little site you found.

### Instructions
Complete the [XSS Game](https://xss-game.appspot.com/).

Document your process in a PDF.

## Task 2 - Packet Capture:
#### Scenario
You stumbled upon the log file of your coworker! Maybe you can take a peek to see what kind of things he's looking at during work hours and rat him out to the boss if it's not work-related.
#### Instructions
Write a script that parses through the log compiles a list of all the unique referers.

Sort the referers by number of occurrences. 

Script can be in a language of your choice.

This is it. The culmination of all your work. Let's do it.

#### Instructions
