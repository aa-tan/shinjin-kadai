#Newcomer's Challenge
You are a disgruntled employee working as an engineering Intern of Drones R Us. Despite your warnings, their security practices are out of date and you are deadset on showing them just how dangerous that can be. You intend to first mess with your other employees by impersonating them on the company chat. Then, you plan to fix the system and present your findings to the head of security codename: aa-tan.

##Task 1 - XSSGame:
###Scenario
In order to hone your XSS skills for the eventual attack on the company chatroom, you decide to practice with a neat little site you found.

###Instructions
Complete the [XSS Game](https://xss-game.appspot.com/).

Document your process in a PDF.

##Task 2 - Packet Capture:
####Scenario
You stumbled upon the log file of your coworker! Maybe you can take a peek to see what kind of things he's looking at during work hours and rat him out to the boss if it's not work-related.
####Instructions
Write a script that parses through the log compiles a list of all the unique referers.

Sort the referers by number of occurrences. 

Script can be in a language of your choice.

##Task 3 - GDB
###Scenario
All this XSS work is starting to get boring. To change things up, you decide to check out this tutorial on GDB.
###Instructions

[Complete this tutorial](https://atan.moe/learning-to-use-gdb/).

Submit proof in the form of a text file containing the password.

##Task 4 - Practical test
####Scenario
In order to prove your understanding of XSS before tackling the real deal, you decide to do a mock test and fix a vulnerable JS function.
####Instructions
Access Task 4 and alter the code to fix the exploit.

##Task 5 - Weakchat:

####Scenario

####Instructions
Access [weakchat](http://hack.keio.ninja) chatroom.

Document your process of stealing the cookie and fixing the system using screenshots and explanations. Compile that into a PDF.

Commit your changes and push to the branch. (Include the PDF that contains your explanations)

##Submitting
Go to [this github repository](https://github.com/aa-tan/weak-chat) and clone it.

Make a new branch titled `submission`.
